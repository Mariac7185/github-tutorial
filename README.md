# Git   vs. GitHub
 
##Git    
* Is the version Control which keeps "snapshot" of the code
* Runs in the command line  
* Basic Workflow 
    * Once we initialize git for version control in which we call it a repository
*  Edit files 
*  Add files (to the stage)
    *  We need to create the add command to just choose one 

  
## Github 
* Is when you store information up in the cloud 
    * Your computer: Local Machine in this case Cloud9 
* Runs in the command line
    *to interact with the repository and to visually see the changes bewteen the commits
* Basic workflow
* Visually tracks changes 
* Easily collaborates on files 
* Requires Git

## Initial Setup

### Setting up Git
 1. Open up [Git hub](http://www.github.com)
 2. Under your command line Tell Git your **name** so that your commits will be label correctly. Make sure to type everything after `$`
   ```
    $ git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
```
 3. Make sure that you also let Git know your personal _Email Adress_ that will also be part of the Git commits.  Most importantly make sure that you use the same email that you use in the email settings.Your command should look something like this: 

 ``` 
     $ git config --config --global user.email "Your EMAIL ADRESS"
```
#### The next steps would be confirming with Github if you would be using **HTTPS** or **SSH**

_HTTPS: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure_

* Would require to ype youyr email and your password everytime you log on to github. 

_SSH: Secure Shell_

  * Provides a secure network in which requires a long password
